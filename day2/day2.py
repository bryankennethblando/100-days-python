# Subscripting the string variable inside print: counting from the start
print ("hello"[4]) 
# Subscripting using reverse logic: its like counting backwards
print ("hello"[-1]) 

# lesson 2: variable type casting
print (type(123)) # int
print (type(1.1)) # float
print (type("hello")) # string
print (type(True)) # boolean

# Typecasting
print ("Numbers of letters in your name: " + str(len(input("What's your name? "))))

# PEMDAS
print (3 * (3 + 3) / 3 -3)
